# Country Chain Game

- The player names a country. 
- If it's invalid country or empty, you get 3 tries.
- If it's a valid country but it starts with the wrong letter or the if the country is already mentioned, you lose.
- The computer responds with a valid unused country. 
- The computer only loses when all the countries for that letter is mentioned and it is the computer's turn.
- So, basically the game continues until someone can't move.
